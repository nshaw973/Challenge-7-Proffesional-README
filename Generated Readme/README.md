## Installation

Requires node.js, to run the "node index.js" command in order to get the prompt appearing in the terminal.

## Usage

Prompts will appear and ask for specific questions that the user will need to answer. Once the user has gone through all the questions, a README will be generated alongside a .txt file that contains the license being used for the Repo.
